# Dream Tag Tournament Tools

- Decodes the script into a text file.

- Encodes the text script into the game's format.

- Applies QOL hacks.


# Usage

Place the ROM in the same directory as dtt_conv.exe, name the ROM "DTT.gba" drag "script_dec.txt" into "patch_rom.cmd" and it will output "out_dtt.gba" with the script repointed and with a variable-width font.

Edit "patch_rom.cmd" to change language code.

NOTE: If the base script isn't finished, untranslated lines will just be a garbled mess.
